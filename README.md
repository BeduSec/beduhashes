## 🛠️ How It Works

1. You provide a hash (MD5 or SHA256)
2. The script generates possible passwords (brute force or using a wordlist)
3. It compares the hash of each candidate with the target hash
4. If a match is found, the original password is revealed

## ▶️ Usage Examples

### Python (MD5)

```bash
cd md5
python md5_bruteforce.py
```

PHP (SHA256)

```bash
php sha256/sha256_bruteforce.php
```

Web Version

Open index.html in your browser for a simple client-side brute force demo.
